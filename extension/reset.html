        <h2>About Encryption and Versions 1.2.0 and 1.2.1</h2>
        Encryption was broken in versions 1.2.0 and 1.2.1. Sometimes it would be unable to decrypt secret keys correctly. If you had encryption enabled in those versions and the extension is generating incorrect keys now, please <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/two-factor-authenticator/versions/1.2.1" target="_blank">downgrade to 1.2.1</a> and disable encryption there before using a newer version, or restore your secret keys from a backup.
